headline: Disgustingly <br><em>delightful.</em>
description-html: The Disgusting Food Museum showcases an array of culinary creations that may not be deemed appetizing by most. This unique exhibition boldly challenges visitors to confront their preconceptions about food and even invites them to experience a few dishes at the daring tasting bar.<br><br>The branding approach revolves around the notion that what disgusts one person might delight another. Collaborating with my former KW43 colleagues, Alexander Geh and Rüdiger Goetz, we crafted a branding concept that transforms the repulsive into a visually enticing and mouth-watering experience.
