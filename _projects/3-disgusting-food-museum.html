headline: Disgustingly <em>delightful.</em>
description-html: The Disgusting Food Museum features a lot of dishes that most people would not consider particularly appetizing. However, the exhibition challenges the visitors to question their prejudices towards food and even try a few dishes at the tasting bar, if they're brave enough.<br><br>The branding emphasizes that one person's disgust might be another person's delight. Together with my former KW43 colleagues Alexander Geh and Rüdiger Goetz, we developed a branding that makes disgusting look delicious.

        description-html: While coming up with ideas for the branding we realized, that each language has it's own expression of disgust. Since we wanted to emphasize the international aspect of the museum we used these expressions as the main part of the branding.
