description-html: The Disgusting Food Museum features a lot of dishes that most people would not consider particularly appetizing. However, the exhibition challenges the visitors to question their prejudices towards food and even try a few dishes at the tasting bar, if they're brave enough.<br><br>The branding emphasizes that one person's disgust might be another person's delight. Together with my former KW43 colleagues Alexander Geh and Rüdiger Goetz, we developed a branding that makes disgusting look delicious.
