    quote: We can wholeheartedly recommend Tara's services. She created a very smart logo including guidelines and a matching website for us. Throughout the process she not only paid attention to the design but also helped us structure our thoughts and pointed out details we wouldn't have thought of ourselves. We are super happy with the results. <br>Thank you Tara!
